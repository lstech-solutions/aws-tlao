# Why "Tactical"?

The word **Tactical** in TLÁO refers to the time horizon and level of concreteness in the actions it produces. TLÁO operates at the tactical level—not strategic, not operational, but tactical.

## Understanding the Three Levels

### Strategic (Long-term, Abstract)

Strategic thinking operates on timescales of months to years and deals with high-level goals:

- "We should expand into the European market"
- "Our goal is to become carbon neutral"
- "We need to build a stronger engineering culture"

Strategic decisions are important but not immediately actionable. They require breaking down into smaller pieces.

### Tactical (Short-term, Concrete)

Tactical thinking operates on timescales of days to weeks and produces specific, actionable steps:

- "Draft the grant proposal by Friday"
- "Schedule a meeting with the design team this week"
- "Review and merge the authentication PR"
- "Submit the invoice to accounting by Tuesday"

Tactical actions are concrete, time-bound, and can be executed immediately or in the near future.

### Operational (Immediate, Mechanical)

Operational execution happens right now and involves specific commands or clicks:

- "Click the 'Create Issue' button"
- "Run `git commit -m 'fix: auth bug'`"
- "Enter '2024-03-15' in the date field"

Operational steps are the actual mechanics of using tools.

## TLÁO's Tactical Focus

TLÁO operates at the **tactical level** because this is where the most value is created:

## Characteristics of Tactical Actions

TLÁO produces actions that are:

### 1. Time-Bound

Every tactical action has a timeframe:

- "This week"
- "By Friday"
- "Before the meeting on Tuesday"
- "Within 3 business days"

This creates urgency and enables prioritization.

### 2. Concrete

Tactical actions are specific enough to execute:

- ❌ "Improve documentation" (too vague)
- ✅ "Add API examples to the authentication docs" (concrete)

- ❌ "Follow up on the grant" (unclear)
- ✅ "Email the program officer about eligibility requirements" (specific)

### 3. Actionable

Someone can start working on it immediately:

- Has a clear owner or assignee
- Doesn't require extensive planning
- Can be completed in a reasonable timeframe
- Has clear success criteria

### 4. Contextual

Includes enough context to execute without hunting for information:

- Why this action matters
- What it depends on
- Who needs to be involved
- Where to find relevant information

## Examples of Tactical Outputs

### From an Email Thread

**Input**: Long email chain about a potential partnership

**TLÁO Tactical Output**:

- Schedule intro call with partner by end of week
- Draft partnership proposal outline (2 pages)
- Get legal review of proposed terms
- Prepare budget estimate for finance review

### From a Grant Opportunity

**Input**: PDF of grant requirements and deadlines

**TLÁO Tactical Output**:

- Verify eligibility criteria (due: today)
- Gather required documents (budget, bios, letters)
- Draft project narrative (due: 1 week)
- Submit internal approval request (due: 3 days)
- Final submission (due: grant deadline)

### From Meeting Notes

**Input**: Transcript of project planning meeting

**TLÁO Tactical Output**:

- Update project timeline in Notion
- Assign design tasks to Sarah
- Schedule architecture review for next Tuesday
- Document decisions in project wiki
- Send summary email to stakeholders

## Why Not Strategic or Operational?

### Why Not Strategic?

Strategic planning requires human judgment, long-term vision, and organizational context that AI systems can't fully replicate. TLÁO doesn't try to set your company's direction—it helps you execute on the direction you've already chosen.

### Why Not Operational?

Operational execution is already handled by existing tools and APIs. TLÁO doesn't need to click buttons for you—it tells you (or your systems) which buttons to click and why.

## The Tactical Sweet Spot

The tactical level is where:

- **Humans struggle most**: Too many inputs, too much context-switching, too easy to forget
- **AI can help most**: Pattern recognition, information extraction, prioritization
- **Value is highest**: Turning information into action is the bottleneck in most workflows

TLÁO focuses on this sweet spot, transforming the chaos of information into the clarity of next actions.
