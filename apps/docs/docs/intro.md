# Welcome to TLÁO

**TLÁO** (Tactical Layer for Action & Outcomes) is a middleware system that sits between the chaos of unstructured reality and the precision of execution systems.

## What is TLÁO?

TLÁO transforms messy, real-world inputs into concrete, actionable outcomes. It bridges the gap between:

- **Unstructured Reality**: Emails, PDFs, meeting notes, invoices, transcripts, grant pages
- **Execution Systems**: GitHub issues, calendars, Notion/Jira, proposal documents, budgets, deployments

## Why TLÁO?

In modern work environments, information comes from everywhere in every format. TLÁO provides a unified layer that:

1. **Ingests** diverse inputs without requiring standardization
2. **Understands** context and extracts structured information
3. **Reasons** tactically about what needs to happen next
4. **Executes** by interfacing with your existing tools
5. **Orchestrates** the entire process with full audit trails

## Core Concepts

To understand TLÁO, you need to grasp three fundamental concepts:

- **[Why "Layer"?](concepts/why-layer)** - TLÁO sits between unstructured inputs and structured outputs
- **[Why "Tactical"?](concepts/why-tactical)** - Focus on short-horizon, concrete, actionable steps
- **[Action & Outcomes](concepts/action-outcomes)** - Tasks, owners, deadlines, dependencies, and results
